> Golang Logrus Enable Opentelemetry Trace ID and Span ID in all Application Logs

link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72839497/12897479

the problem is `span := trace.SpanFromContext(entry.Context)` can not get span context.

maybe you should inject `req.Context()` to logrus then print log

```go
	otelHandler := otelhttp.NewHandler(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
		//log.Info("About End Point Printning...")
		// inject req.Context
		log.WithContext(req.Context()).Info("About End Point Printning...")
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "about page")
	}), "About")
```

run the `server.go`, and then run `client.go`, the output is

```log
{"Context":{"TraceID":"00000000000000000000000000000000","SpanID":"0000000000000000","TraceFlags":"00","TraceState":"","Remote":false},"level":"info","message":"Listening...","span_id":"0000000000000000","time":"2022-07-02T21:39:49+08:00","trace_id":"00000000000000000000000000000000"}
{"Context":{"TraceID":"7cab2739ea2c5b2d3e6a08cfb57858a9","SpanID":"ec5ba151b6823658","TraceFlags":"01","TraceState":"","Remote":false},"level":"info","message":"About End Point Printning...","span_id":"ec5ba151b6823658","time":"2022-07-02T21:39:54+08:00","trace_id":"7cab2739ea2c5b2d3e6a08cfb57858a9"}
```

notice: the first line not print traceId is because there is no request

hope it is helpful for you.
